# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine.

# Technologies

- JavaScript
- ES lint
- MongoDB
- Express.js

## Plan on improving the project

The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization which will be implemented over the next few weeks.
